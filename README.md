# Wireframe-and-Mockup
hello everyone its Bilal Zaro again....
today i  made up a wireframe and mockup for a coffee shop website
first thing i used only 3 colours in this website: orange,black and white ,i used only this colours to avoide 
the feeling when you goes to a website that has to many colours and just your eyes get dirty from just looking
so lets talk about the design 
home page: 
in contains a nav bar as a head like others page and a logo on its left and a sign in/up button on the 
right the hero section contain an image with some words i think the visitor well like it and also i put about
a auto slider that have 3 photos and a customer reviewe and a footer in every page almost 
menu page : i put a 3 items with mouth-water images and a breif description and there price and a button
says "add to cart" and a catigory in the top
about us :
i putted an coffee image with the history of the coffee shop and down it i added our famos employee
and the last thing is some state and facts about us
contact us: it has a feedback form with captcha and a link to our social media finally a live chat button that is working
cart page: 
it contain the items you added and the payment method with the total,card number and thats 
and i just want to say sorry for the none completed work i just got tired and cant keep continue
